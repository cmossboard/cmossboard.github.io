We get it, people get sick, reach out to a manager as soon as possible so we can try and get your shift covered please. Calling out sick should be done at least 4 hours before your shift change when possible. If you know you can't make it for a shift please let one of us know so we can get it covered. Call a manager as soon as you know you canâ€™t make your shift. Phone numbers are listed [here](/#management-team)
