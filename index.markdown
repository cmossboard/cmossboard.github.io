# Ready for some friendly competition?

OK, let’s make it interesting, the top performer in each category will take home a $100 bonus in your paycheck at the end of the month. Who doesn’t want free food/gas for doing their job?

Contest will be changed each month so make sure to check with the manager's for the current contest.

Leaderboards are updated every Tuesday.
