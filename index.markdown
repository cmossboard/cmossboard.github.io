Hopefully this will help you with some of the things you will need day to day to make your lives easier. There is a search function up top, and a navigation bar
on the side. If you want something added please let Chris know. If you find something not working shoot me an email [chmoss@bowlero.com](mailto:chmoss@bowlero.com). Please be nice this is not 
an official work project and only being done as a volunteer project to make our lives easier.

# Ready for some friendly competition?

OK, let’s make it interesting, the top performer in each category will take home a $100 bonus in your paycheck at the end of the month. Who doesn’t want free food/gas for doing their job?

Contest will be changed each month so make sure to check with the manager's for the current contest.

Leaderboards are updated every Tuesday.
